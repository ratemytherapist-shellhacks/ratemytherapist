                    <p>There a lot of miscponceptions about therpay. It has been stigmatized
                    for so long, but it is a great tool to help with anxiety, trauma, sleep, relationship, and so much more.</p> 

                    <p>Some of the reasons, you should go is when you are having mood swings 
                    that are not expected. If your mood is negative, it could be a sign that maybe you should talk to someone.
                    You can find the source of your problem, when you talk to a therapist. Rachel Fogelberg, a clinical socail worker,  said," “You have the opportunity to open up about your thoughts, feelings and circumstances in a confidential environment,” Fogelberg also said, “Within the safety of this secure environment, individuals can feel comfortable to explore areas of themselves or their lives that they are struggling or unhappy with.”"
                    Fogelberg gives a great explanation of how having a therapist, can be great beucase they will not judge you and you can talk to them without feeling you will hurt someone's feeling and can actually get to your resolve problem quicker this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another reason to go is when you go through a big change, like moving to a new place, or getting a new job, or having a new family. Therapists can help you build strategies and a plan to manage your stress about a situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>When your having harmful thoughts about self-harm and suicide, it can be prevented through treatment with a liscensed professional. When you stop doing things that bring you joy could mean you are losing motivation and that something might be wrong. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you usually are very sociable and then you suddenly stop doing things you usually do, it might be a good reason to seek some help.
                    A therapist's job is to help you uncover what might be happening in that situation. This way you can become the person you want to be and live a mentally happy life.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you are feeling lonely or isolated is a good reason to go to therpy. A lot of peopel with mental health issues feel like they are going through life alone, but group therapy or talking to a professional can help feel like you are not going through life alone. Nancy McCorry works at the University of Michigan’s Addiction Treatment Services say, "When you enter therapy ... you get the immediate sense of relief that you are not alone."   
                    McCory shows you that a benefit of therapy is that you do not feel alone and are understood by other, which can give you hope.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you are using drugs and alcohol to deal with issues in your life, is a time to reach out to a professional. McCroy says, "Addiction and substance abuse are medical conditions ― not character flaws, McCorry stressed."Getting eveidence based treatment can help you with your addiction and therapy can help you adress it and lead you to a plan to help you with it.
                        Another reason you should go to a therpaist is when you feel like you have lost control of your life. This feeling happens a lot in substance abuse. The feeling of lack of control in situations can lead to cycles of substance abuse. The use of substance can come from not wanting to feel an pain or burdens, even though the feelinds are still there. Going to therpy can help you lift that burden feeling. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>When you feel like your relationship with someone is strained, having a therapist can help people communicate better and solve problems that a couple, freinds ,or family or having. This can help strengthen your relationship and make you happier.  </p>
                    <p>Go to a theprist when you think you might have serious mental health conditons, like a bipolar disorder or schizophrenai. These conditions rarly develop from nowhere, so taking the right steps to treat them is a must. </p>

                    <p>When you sleeping patterns are off, like having insomnia or sleeping too much, it could be a sign for sometihng serious. Going to a professional can help yuo find out what is wrong and help you treat it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, if you feel like you need to talk to someone, go for it. Therapy is normal to do and can help you solve problems you have beening dealing with alone. </p>
